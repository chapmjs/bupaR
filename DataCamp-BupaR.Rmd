## Introduction to process analysis

<https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/business-process-analytics-in-r>

```{r}
library(bupaR)
library(eventdataR)

eventdataR::patients

# How many patients are there?
n_cases(patients)

# Print the summary of the data
summary(patients)

# Show the journey of the first patient
slice(patients,1)

# How many distinct activities are there?
n_activities(patients)

# What are the names of the activities?
activity_labels(patients)

# Create a list of activities
activities(patients)

# Have a look at the different traces
traces(patients)

# How many are there?
n_traces(patients)

# Load the processmapR package using library
library(processmapR)

# Visualize the traces using trace_explorer
trace_explorer(patients,coverage=1)


```
## Create Process Maps
```{r}
# Load processmapR
library(processmapR)

# Draw process map
process_map(patients)
```


## Construct event data objects
```{r}
# Read claims data
# install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

claims <- read_excel("data/claims.xlsx")

# Look at the structure of claims
str(claims)

# Create an eventlog of claims
claims_log <- eventlog(
  claims,
  case_id = "id",
  activity_id = "action_type",
  activity_instance_id = "action",
  timestamp = "date",
  lifecycle_id = "status",
  resource_id = "originator"

)

# Print summary
print(summary(claims_log))

# Check activity labels
activity_labels(claims_log)
```

## Specialization of resources

```{r}
sepsis <- eventdataR::sepsis

# Calculate frequency of resources
frequencies_of_resources <- resource_frequency(sepsis, level = "resource")

# Change the level to activity
frequencies_of_resources <- resource_frequency(sepsis, level = "activity")

# Change the level to resource *and* activity
frequencies_of_resources <- resource_frequency(sepsis, level = "resource-activity")


# See the result
frequencies_of_resources

# See the result as a plot
plot(frequencies_of_resources)


# Calculate resource involvement
involvement_of_resources <- resource_involvement(sepsis,level="resource")

# See the result
involvement_of_resources

# Show the result in a plot
plot(involvement_of_resources)

```

## Process variants
```{r}
# Explore traces with 10% coverage
trace_explorer(sepsis, coverage=.1)

# Calculate the average trace length
trace_length(sepsis)

sepsis %>% 
  # Check the activity presence
  activity_presence() %>% 
  # Plot the results
  plot()
```

## Rework
```{r}
# Min, max and average number of repetitions
number_of_repetitions(sepsis)

# Number of repetitions per resource
number_of_repetitions(sepsis, level = "resource")

# Number of repetitions per activity
n_reps_per_activity <- number_of_repetitions(sepsis, level = "activity")

# See the result
n_reps_per_activity

# See the result in a plot
plot(n_reps_per_activity)
```

## Precedence matrix
```{r}
sepsis %>% precedence_matrix(type = "absolute") %>% plot()
sepsis %>% precedence_matrix(type = "relative") %>% plot()
sepsis %>% precedence_matrix(type = "relative-antecedent") %>% plot()
sepsis %>% precedence_matrix(type = "relative-consequent") %>% plot()
```

## Performance analysis
```{r}
# Need to add source of data


# Draw a process map of median performance in hours
eat_patterns %>% 
  process_map(type = performance(FUN = median, units = "hours"))

eat_patterns %>% 
  # Calculate variation in processing times of activity durations
  processing_time(level = "activity") %>% 
  # Plot it
  plot()

# Draw a dotted chart of relative data sorted by start day
eat_patterns %>% 
  dotted_chart(x = "relative_day", sort = "start_day", units = "secs")
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
